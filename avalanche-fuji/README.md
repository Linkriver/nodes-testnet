## Introduction 
All our testnet nodes offer jobs that allow a smart contract deployed to the respective network to retrieve data from external APIs through a direct request.
Please make sure you have read the official [Chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/architecture-request-model) on the direct request (also called basic request) model. 
After that, you should read the rest of the [documentation](https://docs.chain.link/any-api/introduction) on retrieving data from any API, which also details how to send a GET request from a smart contract. 

## Request details 
For detailed information such as Oracle address, job IDs, node job specifications and example consumer contracts, please navigate to the folder of the respective job.
If you need help testing or want us to add a custom job or External Adapter to our node for you, please join our [LinkRiver Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/xRWKtpjA9F) where you can always reach a team member, we are happy to help you with the realization.  

## Mainnet launch and data feeds
If you want to migrate your direct request to a mainnet or need a customized data feed, for example, please visit our website and submit a request for our [Custom Chainlink service](https://linkriver.io/custom-chainlink) to us.
Regardless of which chain you test one of our jobs on, we can reproduce it on any EVM-based network supported by Chainlink, on the testnet or mainnet. A list of the currently officially supported networks can be found [here](https://docs.chain.link/resources/link-token-contracts).
